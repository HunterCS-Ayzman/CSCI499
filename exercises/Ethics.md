## Ethics

Think through how your project idea affects the world. Approach your product through the lenses of: 

* Discrimination & Bias
* Inclusion & Equity
* Privacy & Security
* Freedom of Speech
* Automation & Job Eradication
* Predatory Behavior & Perverse Incentives
* Unintended Consequences

After you've come up with some ethical issues with your product, how will you change your idea?
