## Ideation

In this class, you will go through several rounds of generating ideas in a group setting. Check out some of the interesting ideas created in [our Ideation class on 1/30/19](/classes/1.30.19/ideas-generated.xlsx).

### Mass Idea Generation Round

#### HMW Selection Stage
Choose three HMWs to focus on as a group. One method of choosing is voting for all of the ones you like. The two strongest liked HMWs win. In event of tie, vote again, but only once, on the tied HMWs. In the event of another tie, choose any tie breaking metric you wish (coin flip, choose a hand behind your back, etc.). Take five minutes for this.

#### Mass Idea Generation Stage
Come up with as many ideas as possible for any of the HMWs. At this stage, quantity is what matters. Ignore technical feasibility and business viability.

Create post-it notes representing your ideas. On the front, put a short name or tagline and an optional picture. On the back, optionally, put a short description and the related HMW. Take ten minutes for this.

#### Idea Presentation Stage
Choose your own favorite two or three ideas. Share each idea in three or four sentences. One sentence about your inspiration, the rest succinctly explaining the idea. Come up with more ideas as others share. Take up to fifteen minutes for this.

Remember, ideas are cheap. Someone has almost certainly thought of your idea. Itâ€™s execution that matters. So don't be afraid to share your ideas with each other. Remember the goal of Capstone. To learn and collaborate.

#### Wild Card Stage
People can have a general discussion about what they liked and any other ideas that came to them during others' presentations. Take five minutes for this.

### Voting
Eventually you're going to have to cut ideas down. I like to ask myself three questions:

* Do I care about this?
* Will I learn something interesting from this?
* Do I want to work on this for three/four months?

For each idea, everyone in the group should answer yes to at least two of these questions. That being said, you can feel free to vote on ideas however else you'd like.
