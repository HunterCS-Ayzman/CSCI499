## Inspiration

### Theme Generation

First, we're going to do some solo inspiration for 15 minutes. There will be three questions to get our juices flowing. In response, try to come up with single words. At this stage, avoid phrases like "reducing homelessness in NYC" where simply "homelessness" will suffice. We're generating only themes for now.

Here are the resulting word clouds from the 1/28/19 class:

![What matters to you?](/images/inspiration-matters.png)

![What can be made more efficient?](/images/inspiration-efficient.png)

![What does this world lack?](/images/inspiration-lack.png)

### A to B (to C?) Flashbacks

For the next phase, we're going to randomly join into groups of five or six. Introduce yourselves to each other. Take a look at all the themes the class generated. They're bound to remind you of something. Maybe a cool website you visited, a community space you frequented, an awesome person you met. Succinctly write your thoughts down on sticky notes.

Spend two minutes (each) sharing your ideas with each other. As you hear other people's flashbacks, write down any other ideas that you think of. You'll have some "wild card" time at the end to talk about any new ideas that came later or whatever else you'd like. You'll have 20 minutes total for this exercise.

### "How Might We..." Generation

As a group, take all of your inspiration points and lay them out. You're at the stage now when you're trying to "ask the right questions." Work together to create questions that begin with "How might we..." (HMW). The goal here is to find opportunities for design. Your HMWs should generate a number of possible answers and will become a launchpad for your ideation brainstorms. 

For each HMW you create, ask yourself if it allows for a variety of solutions. If it doesn’t, broaden it. If it allows for way too many, narrow it. A good HMW should give you both a narrow enough frame to let you know where to start your brainstorm, but also enough breadth to give you room to explore wild ideas.

Here are some example HMWs posed for the Cornell Tech Product Studio:

* How might we tackle teenage weight loss in a manner that makes teenagers feel good about themselves and not like they are on a program? (Weight Watchers)
* How might we create a new online marketplace that harnesses the power of the sharing economy to benefit low-income wage earners? (Robin Hood)
* How might we use artificial intelligence to motivate and impact behavior change in patients? (AiCure)
* How might we create an application that provides comprehensive and multidisciplinary information, tools and resources for domestic violence survivors while also protecting their safety and privacy? (The New York Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence)
* How might we encourage people to get a balanced view on controversial topics such as gun control regardless of their (political) leanings? (Google)
* How might we use wearables and/or sensors to enhance a design researcher’s ability to draw more valuable insights while in the field? (frog)
* How might we increase consumers’ understanding of how to take advantage of Smart Home tech? (Samsung)
* How might we help people write more clearly, effectively, and grammatically? (Grammarly)

### Wild Cards

One point of inspiration that I like is encouraging people to take two separate themes and see what interesting HMWs or ideas you can generate from that. For instance, what cool stuff can you come up with if you combine "healthcare" and "music," or "transportation" and "compassion?"
