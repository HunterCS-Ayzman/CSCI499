## Exercises

### General Process

In this course, we want to build something great. So let's set ourselves up for success. I will spend the first few classes facilitating some exercises for the benefit of you and your teams. We're going to work together by broadly and iteratively taking the following steps:

1. Coming up with some themes
2. Asking the right questions
3. Generating a ton of ideas
4. Cutting down the possibilities
5. Maturing the concept

The first two steps are about [inspiration](/exercises/Inspiration.md). We've absorbed a lot throughout our lives and we've contributed much in return. Let's find positive ways to transform those things into the foundation of our ideas.

The next two steps are about [ideation](/exercises/Ideation.md). Don't let perfect get in the way of good. Our ideas suck, especially from the get go. But let's not let that block us from coming up with a bunch of ideas. The hard part is separating ourselves from our babies and letting them go. But always remember your goal: to build an awesome product.

But in class and on your own, your team will go through the last step. This encompasses a number of different things, including the [ethical](/exercises/Ethics.md) concerns and scope of your project. Hopefully, you'll (positively) iterate on your idea throughout the semester.

### Kind Reminders & Suggestions

Since you'll be working together in teams, here are some kind reminders/suggestions about how to conduct yourself (in addition the [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), of course):

* Mind yourself. Don't be an asshole. Don't dominate the conversation. These are all cooperative exercises. When in doubt, err on the side of checking yourself. Whoever speaks the most isn't necessarily the best, most correct, or most representative of the whole group's opinion. Remember that, both as a speaker and as a listener.
* Shimmy your hands if you like an idea. If you're indifferent or don't like it, don't do anything. This is a great silent way of providing affirmation.
* Be succinct when sharing your ideas. If someone else is taking a long time to explain their idea, just point your finger up. If you're presenting and see this, wrap up your last sentence.
* You should take notes. It'll help you remember things, especially in subsequent classes. You can even take notes when others are speaking, but please be respectful about it.
