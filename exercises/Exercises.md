## Exercises

In this course, we want to build something great. So let's set ourselves up for success. I will spend the first few classes facilitating some exercises for the benefit of you and your teams. We're going to work together by broadly and iteratively taking the following steps:

1. Coming up with some themes
2. Asking the right questions
3. Generating a ton of ideas
4. Cutting down the possibilities
5. Maturing the concept

The first two steps are about [inspiration](/exercises/Inspiration.md). We've absorbed a lot throughout our lives and we've contributed much in return. Let's find positive ways to transform those things into the foundation of our ideas.

The next two steps are about [ideation](/exercises/Ideation.md). Don't let perfect get in the way of good. Our ideas suck, especially from the get go. But let's not let that block us from coming up with a bunch of ideas. The hard part is separating ourselves from our babies and letting them go. But always remember your goal: to build an awesome product.

But in class and on your own, your team will go through the last step. This encompasses a number of different things, including the [ethical](/exercises/Ethics.md) concerns and scope of your project. Hopefully, you'll (positively) iterate on your idea throughout the semester.
