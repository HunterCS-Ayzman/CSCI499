## Schedule
You'll notice that the schedule below is quite empty. It's for you to fill! Unless I have something planned, the default is that each class is dedicated time for you and your team to meet and work together. However, you can provide lecture topic suggestions and requests, invite people to speak to the class, and give tech talks. Let me know what you're interested in!

I will do my best to provide this on my own, but I'm throwing the ball into your court. I challenge everyone, but especially each group's team lead, to bring someone in! I'll be happy to serve as the connector and introducer where I can, of course. Capstone is all about your enlightenment.

Some mentors we should consider bringing in:

* Technical team leads
* Recently graduated software engineers
* Seasoned full-stack web developers

Some possible lecture topics could cover:

* Planning and prototyping
* Version control and code reviews
* Public speaking
