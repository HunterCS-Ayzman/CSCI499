## Schedule
You'll notice that the schedule below is quite empty. It's for you to fill! The default is that each class is dedicated time for you and your team to meet and work together. Otherwise, you can provide lecture topic suggestions and requests, invite people to speak to the class, and give tech talks. This course is about your enlightenment! Share your knowledge with your peers!
