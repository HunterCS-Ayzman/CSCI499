## Team Project Requirements

### Team Dynamics
Teams will be formed around themes and preferences into groups of four to six. Therefore, each teams must have one team lead and three to five software engineers. The team lead helps find resources, mentors, and events for the rest of the developers to learn from/use, and codes 20 - 40% of the time. The remaining team members will work on specific research + development tasks in service of the larger project.

### Technologies
Your project must utilize at least two platforms and be written in at least two languages. A good rule of thumb is that there should be a front-end and a back-end. It could use an API or be predictive. These are suggestions, not hard rules.

### Administration
You must invite your course instructors to both your project management board and your code repository. Feel free to add us with reduced permissions, e.g., as collaborators or only with read permissions. If inviting instructors pushes against certain "free-tier" limits, discuss some possible solutions with us that still allows us access.

### Final Project
Your final project must be shareable/deployable/viewable in some way. Your instructors, future employers, peers, friends, family, and customers want to see/use the fruits of your labor! But they shouldn't have to set up a whole development environment in order to do so. Not only is it important to grading, but you're making all their lives easier.
