## Written Assignments

### Requirements Document
Your team must produce a structured set of requirements about your project. Your document can be follow any format, so long as it is clear, understandable, and communicative. Try not to exceed four pages (excluding images).

I strongly encourage you to base your document on the plethora of good examples/templates available online. Naturally, your requirements document will form the foundation for more specific "user stories" and "tickets" down the line in your project management tool. In the document, be sure to include at least the following bits of information:

* Purpose/Goal
* Justification
* Functional Capabilities
* Limitations & Risks
* Ethics Considerations

Keep in mind that you can include more if it's relevant or important, such as a sitemap, a glossary, graphs, or wireframes.

### Final Writeup
Imagine that this is the final README for your project. What information would you want to know? This is a requirements document, an installation guide, a usage guide, and a reflection all in one.
