## Presentations
Aim to be succinct in your presentations. Just because there's an upper limit on the time, it does not mean that you have to take all of it. There will always be time for 10 minutes of questions after your presentations. Aim to have all of your team members speak, if possible.

### Pitch Presentation
Your pitch cannot exceed 10 minutes. Keep in mind that this will be the first time the class will "meet" your team and learn about your idea. Be sure to introduce everyone. Provide a justification for the idea, even if it's not based on concrete evidence or tapping into a market need. In other words, tell us the who, what, and why.

### Progress Presentation
Progress presentations cannot exceed 15 minutes. Each team member must speak. Be sure to talk about the technologies you're using and any technical challenges you're facing. 

### Final Presentation
Your final presentations cannot exceed 25 minutes. It must pitch the idea, provide justification, and include a demo of your project.
