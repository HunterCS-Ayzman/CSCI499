## Grading
Please check out the [syllabus](/docs/Syllabus.pdf) for the team grade breakdown. For the particular grading rubric of each assignment, please check out the relevant section under [Requirements](/README.md#requirements).

As the syllabus says: _"Your individual final grade is based on your team grade..., your group peersâ€™ rating of your individual contribution, and my personal instructor discretion. If your peers believe that you adequately meet reasonable expectations, you will likely receive the team project grade, as is. Equivalently, if you do not meet expectations, you will likely receive a proportionally lower grade, and if you exceed expectations, you will likely receive a proportionally higher grade."_

Mathematically, your final grade is a multiple of the team grade. Effectively, each peer will provide a rating (that correlates to a multiplier). A rating of "adequate" or "expected" would be `1.0`. Exceeding expectations might yield a rating of `1.09`. Failing expectations might yield a rating of `0.87`. I will use some weighted average of your peers' ratings to calculate the raw multiplier. A sample formula might look like this:

As I mention above, I will have discretion over your individual final grade. If there are issues or grievances, I will be happy to address and discuss them with you.
